# **Project Setup**
This project requires Java 11 to be installed on your system. This is because the Jenkins server used in this project requires Java 11.

- First, switch to the "servers" branch. Then, copy all the files from this branch to a directory of your choice.

--To start the Jenkins server, run the start_jenkins_server.bat file.

--To start the Grid server, run the start_grid_server.bat file.

-Once the servers are running, you can access the Jenkins dashboard by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your web browser. The login credentials are as follows:

username: admin
password: 601208f8a7174ca395e944c5be58b7e3
After logging in, you can use the "Automation" job to run connection tests and web tests.

It's important to note that these instructions are for Windows.
